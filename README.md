# **Ready to start?**
My name is Uncle Moses, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2019. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped some people to do the same.

`I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. This free guide/Template is all about blogging for beginners, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes Using this free template!.`

I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.
So, just ***how do you start a blog***?
