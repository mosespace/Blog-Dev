My name is Uncle Moses, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2019. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped some people to do the same.

This free guide/Template is all about blogging for beginners, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills.

I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.
So, just ***how do you start a blog***?
# **Should you start a blog?**
One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.

And because of the format, many successful bloggers **will write about a variety of topics** on the same blog.

In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all. Well, in this tutorial, we will be building a personal blog using css, html and java script.
